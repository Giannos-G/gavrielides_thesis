## Directory Description

In this directory we present the two **docker images** we built in order to evaluate our algorithm and the proposals it suggests. 
Every function of the monolithic application is packaged into multiple indepenent python files (as shown at Fig1) and are to be deployed on a specific node as serverless 
functions while, using the same tools we used to profile our monolithic application, we capture their run-time and energy consumption on the 
specific node (edge device)as shown at Fig2.
