## Directory Description

In this directory we present the two **docker images** we built in order to evaluate our algorithm and the proposals it suggests. 
Every function of the monolithic application is packaged into multiple indepenent python files [^1] and are to be deployed on a specific node as serverless 
functions while, using the same tools we used to profile our monolithic application, we capture their run-time and energy consumption on the 
specific node (edge device)[^2].
