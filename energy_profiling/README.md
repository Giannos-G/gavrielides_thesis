Here we measure the time and the peak memory of a random python script. The profiler writes the results in the *csv* file so that we can use it later when we will analyze the energy each script produces to run in a raspberry pi. The goal is to make a big amount of data (with random python scripts) and then use them to predict the energy a python sciprt will produce in a rpi. 

### Sample:
- example.py
### Profiler:
- time_peak_mem_profiler.py 
### Output file:
- Energy_Profiling_Details_CSV.csv
