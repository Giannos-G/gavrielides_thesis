### NVIDIA Jetson Nano

- ./my_dataset.csv --> The dataset we created by running all of the dataset entries and capturing their run-time and energy consumption.
- ./energy_prediction_tool.py --> The tool we created in order to find the best ML model *(the model with the least MSE)*
- ./working_prediction_tool.py --> After deciding the best-fit ML model here we calculate the predictions
- ./Predictions.csv --> The output of ./working_prediction_tool.py *(our predictions)*


### NVIDIA Jetson Xavier

The same procedure has been followed in ./Jetson_xavier_nx_00

We now have:
